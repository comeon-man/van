<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   This is mainly a more calm and collected collection of Van&#8217;s wrongdoings to
possibly 9+ people.
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   BIG TRIGGER WARNING: RAPE, SEXUAL ASSAULT, MENTAL ABUSE.
DO NOT SEND DEATH THREATS OR HURT HIM, HIS FAMILY DID
NOTHING WRONG, DO NOT HURT ANYONE OVER THIS SITUATION. I
won&#8217;t be holding back on saying what he did but no names but mine will be
said.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-10001"></a>Me, scroll down to see the main acts he did</h3>
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >&#x00A0;    First of all, let&#8217;s start with the tamer things on the list, &#8220;taps&#8221;. I can pretty
positively say I was the first victim to him for a lot of things, emotional, sexual, and
mental abuse starting with punching me in my private area nearly every day I saw
him multiple times a day starting in 7th grade. This act has been seen with several
other people even with people that he didn&#8217;t pursue sexually assaulting. The mental
abuse he did to me seems stupid but to me, a kid that still has a lot of trouble
socializing in a place that I&#8217;m still trying to understand the social environment as an
immigrant.
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   The mental abuse he did to me was very lasting, I would say it has easily had the
longest-lasting impact on me because it was petty as fuck. We had an argument over
Rainbow 6 Siege, a high-intensity, close-quarters first-person shooter that he prided
on being the best in the group, even though he was realistically the only person
taking it seriously. The one situation that set him off and got him to cut me off was
because I was under so much pressure I &#8220;didn&#8217;t know&#8221; the difference between left and
right. He blocked me, wouldn&#8217;t talk to me at school and sat next to me every day at
lunch.
<!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   After we reconciled that we had another similar fight during Christmas break and
that&#8217;s where I had my first big break, I got really emotional and depressed where I
pretty much just stopped making friends in person. I would be good friends with

people online, some people that I made friends with online from a video game, and
some that I barely saw in school. I blame him for my lack of social skills now, he
broke me socially, after we reconciled again like a year later in high school he had the
fucking audacity to say that he changed and he was a better person but instead
of that all he was doing is masking that he&#8217;s still the same manipulative
person.
<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >   I don&#8217;t want to call myself the most broken victim from this whole situation of 3
years of sexually assaulting others, but looking at it now, it took me years
to even start recovering. The others have really good safety nets while I
realize how little I care for myself. I got myself in a relationship where I
knew it was going to end because of my overall schedule. Combining that
with the mental abuse Van was doing to me every day almost broke me
socially again but this time I had a backup which was just another friend
group.
<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >   In the end, all I have to say is&#x2026; at least I made it out of there with the amount of
sanity and emotional stability I still have.
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>His more serious acts on others - </h3>
<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >&#x00A0;    I can&#8217;t say that these acts have directly affected me since he did not rape,
sexually assault me, or mentally abuse me to these extents. But to start off with the
most detailed situation we have, on a certain sleepover during the summer of
2021, Van while mostly everyone and the victim were asleep, Van pulled
up the pants of this victim, took pictures, and jacked them off while the
victim was not fully asleep but so in shock that they could not act, for 3
fucking hours. To add to the disgust that everyone has of the situation, he
then texted the victim&#8217;s significant other about how the victim was excited
during his sleep and was thinking of them(S/O) and how big they were.
This was the situation that set off the first separation of the group. Van
took a hiatus saying it was for his &#8220;mental health&#8221; using his very recent
breakup(literally 1-week relationship) as evidence to sort of support that,
though we found later that he was traveling to Florida and New Orleans. This
hiatus was simply to dodge the instant consequences of his actions on this
victim.
<!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >   These situations have less info on them since these more serious acts were when
the victims were asleep or almost asleep. One situation was where Van straight-up
jerked someone off while they were &#8220;asleep&#8221; but like the previous situation, the
victim was so in shock that they couldn&#8217;t act to stop Van. Another less successful
situation was when Van tried to take the pants off of another potential rape victim
but this time the victim was fully awake and stopped Van. I might have had a
similar situation to these because one time at a sleepover he mentioned
how I had a boner when I was dead asleep and maybe on other sleepovers
he might have acted on me while I was dead asleep but I guess I&#8217;ll never
know.

<!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >   This next situation is a very heavy story of his mental abuse and manipulation.
Van is a very egotistical and narcissistic person, always claiming he is a good person,
pretty much having a hero complex around the group not really thinking that a lot of
people just have conflicting ideas and personalities. This contributed so much to this
heavy mental abuse situation because this person was so badly affected that they had
to be sent to a mental hospital which really only made it worse. Van played
victim throughout the situation yet used others to dig info about this victim
then sending him to a worse facility. This made this victim very depressed
and at a point suicidal but even though they are barely an acquaintance
I&#8217;m very glad they&#8217;re still here and are able to tell their story about this
monster.
<!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >   The last situation I will mention is about his similar sexual abuse of me to this
person whose close family member committed suicide and Van used this mental
vulnerability to take advantage of him and far worsen the damage of the tragic
death.
<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   Side note: as many remember there was a similar situation of CP that Van got
ALC for during 7th grade but this victim hasn&#8217;t come out or reached out &#8216;after the
first roll-out of exposing.
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   Thank you for reading this and if you would like to spread the word of Van&#8217;s
actions please use this doc. This is the most detailed possible account of all his
actions, best of luck to all.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>Red Flags</h3>
<!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >&#x00A0;    All written below is from an anonymous person but not me.
<!--l. 109--><p class="indent" >   I decided that I would share the red flags that I chose to ignore. I still feel at fault
for not noticing them enough and putting it off as him just being a guy. However I
had just come out of a toxic and abusive relationship, and didn&#8217;t know was right
from wrong.
<!--l. 113--><p class="indent" >   He would randomly print out pictures of his friends and keep them with him. It
was his prized possessions, and he loved having attractive friends. He used to show
me pictures of my current boyfriend before we were together. He would talk about his
body and how hot he was. He would remind me that he was out of my league and
told me that nobody deserved a chance with him. He would constantly sexualize him
and his other friends.
<!--l. 119--><p class="indent" >   He would constantly threaten to hurt me if I did something wrong, which I put off
as normal because I was convinced that men act this way and this is the way I would
be treated for being female. He would cuss me out and belittle me and make me feel
like an idiot. He would constantly say he didn&#8217;t care about me and call me a bitch
when I purely wanted to be his friend.
<!--l. 125--><p class="indent" >   He was too comfortable talking about his penis and would ask guys in the many
chats I had been in what everyone&#8217;s size was. I stated to him that this made me very
uncomfortable and he still did it.

<!--l. 129--><p class="indent" >   He was too engrossed in my relationship with my boyfriend. He would
want to know every step of our relationship, and every date we had been
on when it was purely none of his business. I remember he got mad at my
boyfriend and I when we didn&#8217;t immediately tell him we went on our first
date. And when we were finally going out he wanted the two of us one on
one to go to his house for a date so he could make us food and observe
us.
<!--l. 135--><p class="indent" >   He would get mad when someone cared for him and would shut off. While this is
normal, he would be blatantly rude about it. After he was rude he always found ways
to make himself the victim
<!--l. 139--><p class="indent" >   He would make jokes about my suicide attempts, and constantly told me they
were stupid and he would get a good laugh about me struggling. If I was
not in a position where I felt like being honest about my mental health, I
would say &#8220;I&#8217;m typically a happy person!&#8221; he would make it obvious that i
wasn&#8217;t and get a good laugh out of mentioning my depression and suicide
attemps
<!--l. 145--><p class="indent" >   The day after he assaulted my boyfriend when he thought he was asleep, he
texted me commenting on my boyfriend&#8217;s penis. Here is a list of the things he said to
me
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">He was definitely dreaming about you
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">He was hard as fuck
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">He was huge
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">His penis was so sweaty
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">He must want to have sex with you
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">You are lucky he feels this way about you</li></ul>
<!--l. 157--><p class="indent" >   I only started to realize something was up with the last red flag. This is a
reminder to never dismiss odd and creepy behavior. Trust the people who
tell you someone is a bad person, and never let someone belittle you and
make you feel like shit. You are never overreacting, and you are never being
dramatic.
